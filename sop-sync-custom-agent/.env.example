# Jira-Confluence Sync Agent — Credential Reference
#
# This file is for your reference only. The agent does NOT read it.
# When you invoke @jira-confluence-sync, the agent will ask for these
# values in the chat. Provide them there — they are used only for the
# duration of that conversation and are never written to disk.
#
# DO NOT commit real credentials to version control.
